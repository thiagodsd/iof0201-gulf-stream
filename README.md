## Objetivo

Estudar as informações do texto ["Scientists Say Ocean Circulation Is Slowing. Here’s Why You Should Care"](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07052018/atlantic-ocean-circulation-slowing-climate-change-heat-temperature-rainfall-fish-why-you-should-care) do portal _InsideClimate News_.

Em particular a afirmação

> **"Studies suggest it would mean much colder winters and hotter summers in Europe, changing rainfall patterns in the tropics, and warmer water building up along the U.S. coast that can fuel sea level rise and destructive storms."**.
